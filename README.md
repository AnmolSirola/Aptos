# Aptos 

 Aptos is a layer 1 proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain that was founded by former Facebook employees in 2021. It is designed to be a scalable and secure blockchain for decentralized applications (DApps). Aptos uses a novel smart contract programming language called Move, which is a Rust-based language that was developed by Meta (formerly Facebook) for its Diem blockchain project.

Aptos is still under development, but it has already attracted a significant amount of attention from the crypto community. In March 2022, Aptos raised $200 million in a seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Other crypto heavyweights like Tiger Global and Multicoin Capital also participated in the funding round. In July 2022, Aptos raised another $150 million in a Series A round led by FTX Ventures and Jump Crypto. And in September 2022, Binance Labs made a strategic investment in Aptos, bringing its valuation to $4 billion.

Aptos has a number of advantages over other layer 1 blockchains, including:

- `Scalability`: Aptos uses a number of innovative techniques to achieve high scalability, including parallel transaction execution and a unique state management system. Aptos claims to be able to process over 150,000 transactions per second (tps).
- `Security`: Aptos uses a number of security features to protect its users, including a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism and a Move programming language that is designed to be safe and secure.
- `Usability`: Aptos is designed to be easy to use for both developers and users. The Move programming language is relatively easy to learn, and Aptos provides a number of tools and resources to help developers build DApps on the platform.

# Move

Move is a programming language for writing safe smart contracts. It was originally developed by Meta (formerly Facebook) for its Diem blockchain project, but it is now platform-agnostic and can be used to build smart contracts on any blockchain.

Move is a statically typed language with a strong focus on safety and correctness. It uses a resource-oriented programming model, which allows for ownership and transfer of resources to be tracked and verified by the blockchain's consensus mechanism. This makes it very difficult to write buggy smart contracts that can be exploited by hackers.

Move also has a number of other features that make it well-suited for smart contract development, such as:

`Expressiveness`: Move is a relatively expressive language, which makes it easy to write complex smart contracts.

`Tooling`: There is a growing ecosystem of tools and libraries for developing Move smart contracts.
