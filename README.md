# Move

Move is a programming language for writing safe smart contracts. It was originally developed by Meta (formerly Facebook) for its Diem blockchain project, but it is now platform-agnostic and can be used to build smart contracts on any blockchain.

Move is a statically typed language with a strong focus on safety and correctness. It uses a resource-oriented programming model, which allows for ownership and transfer of resources to be tracked and verified by the blockchain's consensus mechanism. This makes it very difficult to write buggy smart contracts that can be exploited by hackers.

Move also has a number of other features that make it well-suited for smart contract development, such as:

`Expressiveness`: Move is a relatively expressive language, which makes it easy to write complex smart contracts.

`Tooling`: There is a growing ecosystem of tools and libraries for developing Move smart contracts.

# Sui 

Sui is a layer 1 proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain that is designed to be scalable, secure, and user-friendly. It was founded in 2021 by former Meta (formerly Facebook) employees Evan Cheng, Sam Blackshear, and Adeniyi Abiodun.

Sui uses a number of innovative techniques to achieve high scalability, including:

- `Parallel transaction execution`: Sui can execute multiple transactions in parallel, which significantly increases its throughput.
- `Object-based state management`: Sui stores data as objects, which makes it easier to update and query state.
- `Move programming language`: Sui uses the Move programming language, which is a Rust-based language that is designed to be safe and secure for writing smart contracts.

In addition to being scalable, Sui is also secure. It uses a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism to ensure that the blockchain is always available and that transactions are always finalized. Sui also uses a number of other security features, such as:

- `Secure Move compiler`: The Move compiler is designed to catch errors in smart contracts before they are deployed to the blockchain.
- `Runtime safety checks`: Sui performs runtime safety checks on smart contracts to ensure that they cannot perform malicious actions.
- `Hardware security modules` (HSMs): Sui uses HSMs to protect its private keys.

Sui is also designed to be user-friendly. It provides a number of features that make it easy for developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) on the platform, such as:

- `Move Playground`: The Move Playground is a web-based IDE that makes it easy to write and test Move code.
- `Sui SDKs`: Sui provides SDKs for a number of popular programming languages, such as Rust, JavaScript, and Python.
- `Sui Developer Community`: Sui has a large and active developer community that is always willing to help new developers get started.

Sui is still under development, but it has already attracted a significant amount of attention from the crypto community. In March 2022, Sui raised $300 million in a funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Other crypto heavyweights like Coinbase Ventures, Paradigm, and FTX Ventures also participated in the funding round.

Sui also has a number of advantages over other layer 1 blockchains, including:

- `Scalability`: Sui is designed to be highly scalable, with a throughput of over 100,000 transactions per second (tps).
- `Security`: Sui uses a number of security features to protect its users, including a BFT consensus mechanism, a secure Move compiler, and runtime safety checks.
- `Usability`: Sui is designed to be easy to use for both developers and users. The Move programming language is relatively easy to learn, and Sui provides a number of tools and resources to help developers build DApps on the platform.


# Aptos 

Aptos is a layer 1 proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain that was founded by former Facebook employees in 2021. It is designed to be a scalable and secure blockchain for decentralized applications (DApps). Aptos uses a novel smart contract programming language called Move, which is a Rust-based language that was developed by Meta (formerly Facebook) for its Diem blockchain project.

Aptos is still under development, but it has already attracted a significant amount of attention from the crypto community. In March 2022, Aptos raised $200 million in a seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Other crypto heavyweights like Tiger Global and Multicoin Capital also participated in the funding round. In July 2022, Aptos raised another $150 million in a Series A round led by FTX Ventures and Jump Crypto. And in September 2022, Binance Labs made a strategic investment in Aptos, bringing its valuation to $4 billion.

Aptos has a number of advantages over other layer 1 blockchains, including:

- `Scalability`: Aptos uses a number of innovative techniques to achieve high scalability, including parallel transaction execution and a unique state management system. Aptos claims to be able to process over 150,000 transactions per second (tps).
- `Security`: Aptos uses a number of security features to protect its users, including a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism and a Move programming language that is designed to be safe and secure.
- `Usability`: Aptos is designed to be easy to use for both developers and users. The Move programming language is relatively easy to learn, and Aptos provides a number of tools and resources to help developers build DApps on the platform.
